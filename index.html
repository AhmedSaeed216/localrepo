<p>this is a new repo.</p>
<p>
    when we make the folder in our pwn laptop
    then how we can upload it to the github
    
    use init command
    init  => use to create a new git repo
    
    
    then use command 
    git remote add origin <link>
                to check our remote is setup correctly use  git remote -v


    git branch
            to check on which branch we are (branch is a copy of the code that we use )
        and rename the branch to     main

        by this command 
        git branch -M main


        then push the code to github by 
        git push origin main


        to make shortcut of this use -u flag then only need to use  git push
